** Compile
*** TODO Add a flag to enable system wide IO.
** Updates
*** Event filter
**** DONE Filter by event number
Use ~PIEvtNbFilter~. Call ~load_filter~ when fill out the information for
event selections. It is in format of
"Run:Event:EventID,Run:Event:EventID".
**** DONE Filter according to Pi decay momentum
Use =PIAna::PIPiDARFilter=. It is in file ~PIFilterPiDAR.hpp~ for historical reasons.
*** Event producer
**** NEXT Produce reconstructed hits
Use ~PIHitProducer~.
***** TODO Hits from geometry and energy loss
****** WAITING Hits from geometry
Use ~PIAnaHit~ and =PIAnaG4StepDivider=.
****** TODO Merge hits from geometry and keep them according to energy loss.
Use ~PIAnaHit~ and =PIAnaHitMerger=.
<2024-04-09 Tue 15:05> Added energy loss threshold but not tested yet.
**** TODO Produce topology variables in truth
***** HOLD decay position of pions and production position of positrons
<2024-04-09 Tue 15:08> Added simplest scenarios but not tested yet. I
need verify the decay history of pion and positrons. I only require
the particle is pion or positron without verifying the origin of
them.[/]
- [ ] Can it be prompt pion or positron from prompt pion or muon?
- [ ] Can it be from radiactive process? Is it possible to have
  e->egamma in GEANT4 and give me two entries of positrons?
**** DONE Produce topology variables in reconstruction
Use ~PITopoProducer~.
***** DONE Hits are input
Configure =PITopoProducer::rec_hit_name=.
***** DONE Cluster by timing
Use ~PITCluster~.
***** DONE Cluster by topology
Use ~PIXYZCluster~.
*** Event analyzer
**** HOLD Feed input for event display.
Use =PITreeAnalyzer=
**** TODO Analyze topological variables by histograms [0/4]
- [ ] Setup for reconstruction
  - [ ] 1/3 * 120um * (3.875 MeV/cm) = 0.0155 MeV
  - [ ] 3 pixels for connectivity in topo producer? approximately sqrt(2*200^2+120^2)*3 um.
  - [ ] Signals within 1 ns are merged.
  - [ ] Prompt cluster and delayed clusters separated by 5ns.
- [ ] =TNtuple= for multi-dimensional analysis.[0/4]
  - [ ] x, y, z of pion and positron. It can be provided by =PITopoProducer=.
  - [ ] x, y, z of true pion and positron. It can be provided by =PITrueDecPos=.
  - [ ] direction of positrons. It can be provided by =PITopoProducer=.
  - [ ] direction of true positrons -- very hard to determine because
    of definition of hits in truth.
- [ ] =TH2F= for pion stopping location with at least 5 positron hits in
  reconstruction level.
- [ ] =TH2F= for positron directions for reconstruction
  - [ ] I guess it is possible to have something flat in theta and phi.
  - [ ] I use criteria for "center of ATAR". Among [0, 100]x[0, 100]
    strips, I use [10, 90]x[10, 90].
